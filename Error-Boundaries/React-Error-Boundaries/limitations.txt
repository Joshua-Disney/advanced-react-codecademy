React Error Boundaries Limitations


Error boundaries can catch errors that occur during rendering, in lifecycle methods, 
and in constructors of the whole tree below them. Error boundaries do not catch errors 
for event handlers, asynchronous code, server side rendering, or errors thrown in the 
error boundary itself (rather than its children).
